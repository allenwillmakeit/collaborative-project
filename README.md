# collaborative-project

Description of the project
In this project i am going to revamp the whole site by first updating menu tabs to the site and along the way updating the whole look of the system from the fonts, buttons, themes and pages to give the whole thing a new fresh look.

How to Run The Project
in this site we shall be adding a few live transitions and backgrounds to the app and redesigning the whole theme of the page to look a bit fresh by using JSX and CSS and also some little bit of python. To run the project as it is a prototype, we shall be using Sigma app as we shall be operating first with the skeleton of the site.
